# Python Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of various Python projects, showcasing a range of skills and applications in Python programming. The projects include basic tools, APIs, data scraping, and problem-solving exercises, demonstrating versatility and hands-on experience with Python.

## Projects Overview
### Calculator: A simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Weather API: Integration with a weather API to fetch real-time weather information based on a user's location or city name, providing data like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

### Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup (bs4): A web scraping project that uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from websites, process and clean the extracted data, and save it into structured formats like CSV or Excel.

## Samta Assignment:

### Calculate Area: A Python script to calculate the area of basic geometric shapes, such as squares, rectangles, circles, etc.
### Fibonacci Series: A Python program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number, showcasing basic algorithmic programming.
Project Details
## 1. Calculator
This simple calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using Python functions, making it easy to extend and add more complex features.

#### Features:
1. Basic arithmetic operations.
2. Simple text-based user interface.
3. Ability to extend with more complex functions.
## 2. Weather API Integration
This project fetches real-time weather data using an external weather API. By providing the name of a city, the script retrieves the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

#### Features:
1. Fetches weather data using an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Displays real-time weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
3. Handles user inputs to query different cities or locations.
## 3. Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup (bs4)
This project demonstrates how to use BeautifulSoup (bs4) for web scraping. The script extracts specific information from a webpage (e.g., headlines, articles, or product details) and saves it in a structured format like CSV.

#### Features:
1. Scrapes data from webpages using BeautifulSoup.
2. Cleans and processes the extracted data.
3. Saves the data into CSV or Excel format for further analysis.
## 4. Samta Assignment
This part of the project is designed to practice basic problem-solving skills.
